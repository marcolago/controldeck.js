Open up a terminal window, install the dependencies, and run the app.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ node app\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the demo page.\r\n\r\nChoose one of the demos and open the slides and controller links in separate windows. Push the buttons in the controller window to control the slides.\r\n\r\n### Make Your Own\r\nCreate your own slide deck using one of the presentation frameworks. Embed the socket.io and controldeck-slide.js scripts at the bottom of the page, before the `</body>` tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- controldeck.js -->\r\n<script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"/controldeck-slides.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the 2 button controller or create your own. Refer to the examples for how to do it. The code is  straightforward. The controller pages simply use Node.js and socket.io to pass along commands to the slides page.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n### Draftfcb Chicago\r\nWe are the development group at Draftfcb Chicago.
